Maze Solver: Finding the Center with Breadth-First Search

Inspired by global maze-solving competitions, I developed this Python project using the Pygame library. The program employs the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore maze routes, locate the center, and optimize the path. Over the course of 8 months (working on it intermittently), I refined the code to handle various maze types and ensure robust performance.

This project was a challenging yet rewarding journey into pathfinding algorithms and visualization. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own maze-solving adventures!
